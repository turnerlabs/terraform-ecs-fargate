/**
 * Elastic Container Service (ecs)
 * This component is required to create the Fargate ECS service. It will create a Fargate cluster
 * based on the application name and enironment. It will create a "Task Definition", which is required
 * to run a Docker container, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html.
 * Next it creates a ECS Service, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html
 * It attaches the Load Balancer created in `lb.tf` to the service, and sets up the networking required.
 * It also creates a role with the correct permissions. And lastly, ensures that logs are captured in CloudWatch.
 *
 * When building for the first time, it will install a "default backend", which is a simple web service that just
 * responds with a HTTP 200 OK. It's important to uncomment the lines noted below after you have successfully
 * migrated the real application containers to the task definition.
